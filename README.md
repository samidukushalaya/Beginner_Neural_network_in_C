# 🧠 Simple Neural Network in C (AND & OR Gates)

This project demonstrates a basic **single-layer neural network** (perceptron) implemented in **C**, trained to learn the behavior of logic gates: **AND** and **OR**.

It's designed as a learning tool for beginners who want to understand the fundamentals of neural networks without using any external libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- Learn **AND** or **OR** gate using the same code
- Implements:
  - Forward propagation
  - Sigmoid activation function
  - Backpropagation with gradient descent
- Clean, commented C code for easy understanding

## 🧪 Logic Gates Overview

### ✅ AND Gate

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
|   0     |    0    |   0    |
|   0     |    1    |   0    |
|   1     |    0    |   0    |
|   1     |    1    |   1    |

### ✅ OR Gate

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
|   0     |    0    |   0    |
|   0     |    1    |   1    |
|   1     |    0    |   1    |
|   1     |    1    |   1    |

- The more you train, the more accurate the output becomes  <br><br>
  📡 To train the model more to get accurate output,
     - For OR Gate Change the test number in line 28
  - For AND Gate Change the epochs number in line 28
